This data may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.\n\nPlease be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.\n\n### Device Data\n\nWhen you visit our website or interact with our services, we may automatically collect data about your device, such as:\n\n* Device type\n* Unique device identifiers\n* Geo-location data\n\nData we collect can depend on the individual settings of your device and software.
