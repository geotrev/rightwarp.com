  A market leader in retail sheet music, Musicnotes was looking to modernize its
  website and apps.

Sheet music isn't sexy, but that wouldn't stop this company from expanding sheet music availability with a unified set of apps across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices.

The result is a comprehensive redesign that gives customers an unmistakable experience of playing with Musicnotes.
