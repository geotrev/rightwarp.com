Helping customers find a trusted consignment service can be challenging, especially one that can retain personalized service. Rainier Consignment, until recently, has been using a less-than-ideal website in the form of a GoDaddy page builder. While it got the job done, it didn't help the business standout among its peers.

A major goal was set early to showcase Rainier Consignment's commitment to consignors. The new website can direct new and existing consignors through a simple but standardized intake process while highlighting key offerings.

Now, Rainier Consignment is in an ideal position to expand in the coming years as new services become necessary to track consignments for customers in real time, without sacrificing marketing capabilities today.
