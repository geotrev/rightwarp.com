Having recently entered the eBook and Audiobook space Scribd wanted to reflect its new corporate branding into its corporate website. The result is a complex & comprehensive overview of Scribd, both as a company, but also its product offerings, investors, and more. It features custom integrations with blogging tools, Google Maps, and Lever job postings, along with highly custom and responsive layouts documenting the Scribd story.

In addition to building this website, full-time help was provided to modernize the Audiobook player interface, eBook/Audiobook product pages, as well as creation of a highly performant document (PDF) viewing page.

An initial 5 months were spent working in digital product designer before transitioning full-time into software engineering.
