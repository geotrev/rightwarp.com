## Context

In 2022, Garden was in the midst of updating its design system offering to meet accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1), which means creating and rewriting a significant portion of its codebase to meet the needs of Zendesk’s future.

Their primary deliverable consisted of a suite of meticulously designed React components backed by custom-baked React hooks that provide a significant portion of business logic to accompanying components. For instance, Garden’s Tabs component has a useTabs hook that provides key accessibility attributes and handlers for user interactions.

There were three focus areas that needed close attention:

* Creating a standardized component-set for drag & drop (DnD) functionality
* Rewriting a prominent menu component to meet modern accessibility expectations
* Helping plan and implement platform-wide dark mode with existing technologies ([styled-components](https://styled-components.com/))
